## Bash scripting should not be used for

Bash scripting is a way to automate tasks on the command line. However, it should not be used for complex software projects or tasks that require high performance. Bash is not as powerful as other programming languages like Python or C++, and it can be difficult to maintain large scripts.

## What is an API?

An API (Application Programming Interface) is like a bridge that allows different software applications to communicate and interact with each other. It defines the rules and formats for exchanging data and functionality between programs, enabling them to work together.

## What is a REST API?

A REST API is a type of API that follows the principles of Representational State Transfer (REST). It uses standard HTTP methods (like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform actions on resources (e.g., data, files) on a server. REST APIs are commonly used in web development to enable communication between web servers and clients.

## What are microservices?

Microservices is an architectural style where a large application is built as a collection of small, independent services. Each service focuses on a specific task and can communicate with others through APIs. This approach makes it easier to develop, deploy, and scale applications.

## What is the CSV format?

CSV stands for Comma-Separated Values. It is a simple text-based data format where each line represents a row, and the values within a row are separated by commas. CSV files are often used to store tabular data, such as spreadsheets, and can be easily read by various software applications.

## What is the JSON format?

JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation. It is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for both humans and machines to read and write. JSON uses key-value pairs to represent data and is commonly used for transmitting data between a server and a web application.

## Pythonic Package and module name style

In Python, package and module names should be written in lowercase letters, and multiple words should be separated by underscores. For example, `my_package` or `utils_module`.

## Pythonic Class name style

Python class names should follow the CapWords convention, also known as CamelCase. Each word in the name should start with an uppercase letter, and there should be no underscores. For example, `MyClass` or `UserData`.

## Pythonic Variable name style

Python variable names should be written in lowercase letters, and multiple words should be separated by underscores. For example, `my_variable` or `counter`.

## Pythonic Function name style

Python function names should be written in lowercase letters, and multiple words should be separated by underscores. For example, `calculate_sum` or `print_message`.

## Pythonic Constant name style

Python constant names (variables that should not be changed) should be written in uppercase letters, and multiple words should be separated by underscores. For example, `MAX_SIZE` or `PI`.

## Significance of CapWords or CamelCase in Python

CapWords or CamelCase is significant in Python as it helps distinguish different types of names (e.g., classes, functions, variables) at a glance. It makes the code more readable and adheres to the Python community's naming conventions. Following consistent naming styles helps maintain clean and organized code across Python projects.
