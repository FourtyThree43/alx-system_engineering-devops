**How to read API documentation to find the endpoints you're looking for:**
API documentation provides details about the available endpoints (URLs) that you can use to interact with the API. It typically includes information about the HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), the parameters to include in your requests, the expected request and response formats, and more. Look for sections like "Endpoints," "Resources," or "API Reference" in the documentation to find a list of available endpoints. Pay attention to the required and optional parameters for each endpoint.

**How to use an API with pagination:**
Many APIs use pagination to limit the number of results returned in a single request and provide a way to retrieve additional results. Pagination is often achieved through query parameters, such as `page` and `per_page`. You would start by making a request to the API with the desired parameters, and if there are more results, the response will include information about how to retrieve the next page of results (e.g., a `next_page` parameter or a link). You then make subsequent requests with the provided information until you've fetched all the data.

**How to parse JSON results from an API:**
APIs often return data in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format. To parse JSON results, you'll use programming languages like Python, JavaScript, etc. Most languages have built-in libraries or methods to handle JSON. You would typically retrieve the API response and then use a JSON parsing function to convert the JSON string into a data structure that you can work with, such as a dictionary or a list.

**How to make a recursive API call:**
Sometimes, API responses include references to related data that you might want to retrieve in subsequent requests. Recursive API calls involve making additional API requests based on the data received from a previous response. For instance, if an API returns paginated results, you might recursively call the API to fetch all pages until no more pages are available. Recursion allows you to efficiently traverse through nested data structures or perform repetitive tasks.

**How to sort a dictionary by value:**
Sorting a dictionary by its values involves rearranging the dictionary items based on the values rather than the keys. In Python, you can achieve this using the `sorted()` function and a custom sorting key. For example:

```python
my_dict = {'a': 5, 'b': 2, 'c': 8}
sorted_dict = dict(sorted(my_dict.items(), key=lambda item: item[1]))
print(sorted_dict)  # Output: {'b': 2, 'a': 5, 'c': 8}
```

Here, `key=lambda item: item[1]` specifies that the sorting should be based on the values (index 1 of each item).

These concepts are fundamental for working with APIs and data manipulation. Understanding them will enable you to effectively retrieve and process data from various APIs.
